        <h1>Welcome to My First Website!</h1>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to the digital corner where I, <span class="highlight">Ritu Raj</span>, decided to make my mark. This website is my first venture into web development, so you might spot a few imperfections. Consider them a testament to my originality and willingness to learn.</p>
        <p>As a budding developer, I enjoy diving into web technologies, data science, and, occasionally, a good game of chess. (Fun fact: my chess rating fluctuates between "promising" and "oops, there goes my queen.") Creating this website is a step forward in combining my interests with real-world applications.</p>
        <p>While I strive for professionalism, I also believe that every beginner project tells a story. So, if you see any quirks or glitches here, don’t worry – they’re part of the charm. After all, the best way to learn is to try, fail, and try again.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting and taking a moment to explore my work. Whether you’re here out of curiosity or just stumbled upon this by accident, I hope you find something interesting (or at least mildly amusing). Here's to learning, growing, and creating – one line of code at a time!</p>
